# APM-2.6-AHRS-MPU-6000-MS5611-HMC5883L
This repository contains programs written in the Arduino 1.6.5 IDE that enable an Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS). The programs are meant to run on the APM 2.6 microcontroller board. The programs interface the microcontroller to the MPU-6000 inertial sensor, the MS5611 altimeter and the HMC5883L magnetometer.
